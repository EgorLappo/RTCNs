# RTCNs

Code to work with rankings of phylogenetic networks. Contact me (see [egorlappo.me](https://egorlappo.me)) if you want to use this code and need my help.

### Useful features

* Generating one-component tree-child networks (TCNs) and normal networks.
* Generating all non-isomorphic TCNs and normal networks.
* Generating ranked tree-child networks (RTCNs).
